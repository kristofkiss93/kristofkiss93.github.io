                <h1>So, what is a muscle car? And why do people love muscle cars?</h1>
                <p>A muscle car is a high-performance, typically American, rear-wheel-drive vehicle powered by a
                    large-displacement V8 engine. These cars were most popular in the 1960s and 1970s, known for their
                    brutal acceleration, powerful sound, and aggressive design.</p>
                <p>Muscle cars aren't just about speed; they represent freedom, rebellion, and pure American horsepower.
                    Their deep V8 roar, aggressive styling, and raw performance make them more than just cars—they are a
                    statement.
                    Whether you love the classic muscle era or the modern supercharged beasts, one thing is certain:
                    Muscle cars will never go out of style! Now. let's see, what are the basic elements to be a muscle

                            around 290 HP, but with proper tuning, it could push well beyond that. The Z/28 combined
